# MaxDiff Scaling ‚Äî Simple Count Method with Visualizations

This repository contains a Python implementation of **MaxDiff Scaling (Maximum Difference Scaling)** using the **Simple Count method**.  
It is part of a larger series exploring MaxDiff for applied analytics across retail, HR/people analytics, marketing, and more.

## üìå What is MaxDiff?
MaxDiff (or Best-Worst Scaling) is a survey-based technique where respondents are shown sets of items and asked:
- Which is **most important**?
- Which is **least important**?

Compared to rating scales (1‚Äì5 stars, Likert), MaxDiff:
- Forces **trade-offs**
- Reduces **rating biases**
- Produces clear, **rank-ordered preferences**

## üìÇ Contents
- `max_diff_scaling.py` ‚Üí main script  
  - Simulates toy survey responses
  - Computes simple-count preference scores
  - Estimates ~95% confidence intervals
  - Generates two plots:
    1. **CI Lollipop plot** (scores with confidence intervals)
    2. **Executive bar chart** (scaled 0‚Äì100 utilities)
  - Saves results as CSV + PNGs

- `outputs/` (created after running script) ‚Üí contains:
  - `maxdiff_simplecount_results.csv`
  - `maxdiff_simplecount_ci.png`
  - `maxdiff_scaled_bar.png`
